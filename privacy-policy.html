Start with a list, input scores for individual criteria, include estimates of your financial plans and review charts and graphs with your personalised results. Keep refining your model when you have new ideas and updated information; the results pages will continue to illustrate your latest insights. Organising and graphically highlighting your thinking are important steps to help make complicated decisions.
