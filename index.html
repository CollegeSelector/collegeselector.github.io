It's an interactive template helping you to organise and prioritise your own selections. Capture all your thoughts in one place and then graphically show results for your personal comparisons. Topics include groupings for academic life, real life and financial life helping you to research, and review up to 500 variables. Then review your selected schools to see their balance of your individual academic and lifestyle needs. Plot the results using your own scores together with cost projections.

College Selector will help save you time and logically order your thoughts for up to 50 criteria applied to 10 potential schools. Start with a list, input scores for individual criteria, include estimates of your financial plans and review charts and graphs with your personalised results. Keep refining your model when you have new ideas and updated information; the results pages will continue to illustrate your latest insights. Organising and graphically highlighting your thinking are important steps to help make complicated decisions.
